# Background:

## A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a smart contract that allows a group of users to collectively make decisions without relying on a central authority. Typically, decisions are made through proposals and voting. Token holders (or approved members) vote on these proposals, and depending on the outcome, actions may be taken automatically.

# Provision

## A basic implementation of a DAO 


1.	Membership System:
	•	Only members can create proposals and vote. 
	•	!!There should be a way to add members (you can hardcode or create a function for this).
2.	Proposal Management:
	•	Members can create new proposals with a description.
	•	Each proposal has a voting deadline.
	•	Each proposal tracks votes for and votes against.
-	Voting Logic:
	•	Members can vote once per proposal.
	•	Voting can be either in favor or against.
-	Execution:
	•	Once a proposal’s deadline is over, it can be executed.
	•	Execution logic should only trigger if the proposal passes (e.g., more “for” votes than “against”).
	•	You can keep execution as a placeholder function that simulates some change or action.
-	Events:
	•	Emit relevant events for proposal creation, voting, and execution for better transparency.
